    title: 'The Runner',
    description: "<p>The Runner is a War Story set during the Battle of Gallipoli in Turkey in 1915. You will play an Australian soldier and veteran of the Second Boer War, Frederick Bishop. The story begins with Bishop meeting a young soldier named Jack Foster, who tells him that he is a new member of Bishop's team. Although initially cynical, Bishop eventually agrees to Foster fighting alongside him, and tells Foster to refrain from fighting due to his inexperience and young age.</p><p>Bishop stormed the coast of Gallipoli on the Cape of Helles and captured the Ottoman strategic position. Bishop fires a flare to signal his position but is surprised by Foster who is advancing alone, and disobeys Bishop's orders to simply move up with the rest of the Allied forces.</p><p>Bishop berates Foster for his naivety to see war as a noble activity, considering that Foster had also lied to hide his age to enlist in the army. Foster is taken aback when he sees the true horror of war with all the carnage around him, but Bishop softens his stance and assures Foster that they will be fine.</p><p>The next day, Bishop took the initiative to become a runner in place of Foster, whom Bishop deemed inexperienced for the task. Bishop returns to base to deliver the message and is rescued by Foster, who shoots a nearby Ottoman soldier.</p><p>The British officer Whitehall on the front lines sent Bishop to the rear command to inform that the British troops intended to advance further. But Bishop found the command of his allied forces in the rear lines absent, and realized that there was a new plan to withdraw from Gallipoli in defeat and protect its troop withdrawal with artillery fire.</p><p>Remembering that Foster was still on the front lines, Bishop rushed back to pick him up. Reunited with Whitehall, Bishop is surprised to see Foster has joined the attack on the Ottoman fort. Bishop decides to go after Foster, while a distressed Whitehall allows Bishop to disobey the retreat order to have Foster tell him he doesn't have much time.</p><p>Bishop finds Foster and informs him of an imminent artillery attack, but the young Australians say they cannot retreat because they are wounded. Bishop attacks the fort to protect the retreating soldiers and tells Foster to fire a flare when the troop withdrawal is complete so that his troops can retreat safely.</p><p>Bishop single-handedly captured the Ottoman stronghold and was mortally wounded in the battle, but he saw Foster's flare in the sky and was relieved that his withdrawal was successful. The story ends when Bishop finally succumbs to his wounds, watching British warships attack the fort before closing his eyes.</p><p>The Ottomans eventually won the Battle of Gallipoli, and some famous survivors such as Mustafa Kemal Pasha led Modern Turkey after the war. Despite the defeat, Australian and New Zealand troops fought bravely at Gallipoli under their own flags, distinguishing themselves from British troops during the war.</p>"
